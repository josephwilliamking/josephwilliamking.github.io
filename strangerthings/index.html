They began making films in the third grade using a Hi8 video camera that was a gift from their parents. They attended the Duke School for Children from grades K-8, a private suburban school, and then matriculated to the Charles E. Jordan High School, a large Durham public school. They relocated to Orange, California to study film at Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, where they graduated in 2007.[2][3] After writing and/or directing a number of short films, their script for the post-apocalyptic horror film, Hidden, was acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures in 2011.[4] The brothers directed the film in 2012, which was released in 2015. Director M. Night Shyamalan read the script and hired them as writer/producers on the Fox television series Wayward Pines. </p>

With Levy's 21 Laps production company on board, the show was quickly picked up by Netflix.[2][5] The show is set in 1983 Indiana and is an homage to '80s pop culture,[6] inspired and aesthetically informed by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Stephen King, and George Lucas, among others.</p>
                <p class="description paragraph">It premiered in the summer of 2016 to excellent reviews,[9] specifically for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to 1980s genre films, and subsequently began to develop a cult following online.[10] Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the series an approval rating of 95%, based on 55 reviews, with a weighted average score of 8.1/10. The site's critical consensus states, "Exciting, heartbreaking, and sometimes scary, Stranger Things acts as an addictive homage to Spielberg films and vintage 1980s television."[11] On August 31, 2016, Netflix renewed the series for a second season of nine episodes, which were released on October 27, 2017. In December 2017, Netflix renewed the series for a third season.</p>
